Augmented Reality Tutorial/Write-Up
Submitted by: Bradley Downer

Over the years, we've seen things such as flying cars, ray/laser guns, teleportation, etc; this
is usually referred to as science fiction. For decades technology has been evolving and
augmented reality (referred to as AR) is one of the most exciting technologies developed by
Facebook.

Augmented Reality, superimposes a computer-generated image on the user’s view of the
real world. It places 3D objects into our environment (eg; Instagram, Snapchat, and
Facebook filters).

AR is used to create filters, marketing, gaming, education, architecture, etc.
There are many software(s) used, however, Spark AR Studio is the easiest application
/platform/software to use. It gives anyone the ability to create AR experiences and share
them with a million people with a click of a button.

effect. Click on the “add object” button to add an object. There you’d see a list of all
the objects in the Spark AR Studio. You can also select 3D Object to import an object
from your computer.This is where you'd insert an element that will make your effect respond to the person
using it, or someone's environment (eg: face tracker)

assets in Spark AR Studio. Click on the “add assets” button to create assets or
add your own. You can add textures, materials, 3D models, animations, and
